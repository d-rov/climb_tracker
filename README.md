# Climb Tracker

## TODOS:

* Backend
  - [ ] create POST to add climb to db

* Frontend
  - [ ] finish POST
  - [ ] separate functionality into components
  - [x] combine handleChangeName and handleChangeClimb functions

* Unknown
  - [ ] Proxy error on POST request.  Not sure what causes it but the POST still works
        - Proxy error: Could not proxy request /favicon.ico from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:5000/.
See https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors for more information (ECONNRESET).
